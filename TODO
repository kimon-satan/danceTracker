BUG - bank switching doesn't work
    - potential crash when switching to bank setup - recreate

1A - Add zone reset button + call reset on all zones when changing scenes

1. refactoring of testApp
    - move and tidy GUI variables into map vector
    - allScenes can becomes a bank

could put some of the iteration/ search functions into templated class (probably not worth it a this stage)
