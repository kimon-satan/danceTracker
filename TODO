BUGS
     - potential crash when switching to bank setup - (can't recreate ... watch)



1. refactoring of testApp
    - move and tidy GUI variables into map vector
    - allScenes can becomes a bank

2. Bank inmplementation uses old style indexing ... might be safer with a scene wrapper class which can have an individual pointer ?

could put some of the iteration/ search functions into templated class (probably not worth it a this stage)
