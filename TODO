BUGS

    -inverse movement zone triggering on entry 
    (not solvable - result of initial state of user)
   
    - GUI bugs - problems with text boxes on reclick ...
               - issues with create zone toggle on click to side


1. refactoring of testApp
    - move and tidy GUI variables into map vector
    - allScenes can becomes a bank

2. Bank inmplementation uses old style indexing ... might be safer with a scene wrapper class which can have an individual pointer ?

could put some of the iteration/ search functions into templated class (probably not worth it a this stage)
