1. refactoring of testApp
    - allScenes can becomes a bank
    - make a manager class to separate GUI from functionality

2. bug checks
    - make zone light when intercepted / independent of min replay
    - check sensitivity (is there a min pixels ... why slow response? )

3. improving features
    - is segmentation needed at all? (add turn off/on button) 

4. extra features 
    - frame differencing for movement zone

could put some of the iteration/ search functions into an inherited base class (probably not worth it a this stage)
